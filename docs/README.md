# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects using a clear, iterative lifecycle that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Projects start with a concise one‑pager to confirm the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and high‑level timeline. Planning breaks approved initiatives into prioritized, estimated backlog items with defined acceptance criteria and a published Definition of Done; teams use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) to visualize flow and manage dependencies captured in a simple risk register.

The team follows disciplined workflows for delivery: timeboxed sprint planning that only pulls items meeting DoD, small pull requests (target ≤400 lines) with links to issues and acceptance criteria, CI that runs tests and linters before review, and at least one approval required to merge. Release and deployment are standardized by type (patch/minor/major) with pre‑release gating (passing CI, security scans, release notes, rollback plans), a deployment checklist for staging and production, and a documented rollback/incident playbook. Runbooks and templates (e.g., backlog item, release notes) keep work consistent and discoverable.

Roles and communication are explicit: Product Managers own outcomes and prioritization, Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder updates, Developers implement and test changes, QA validates acceptance, and stakeholders provide approvals and inputs. Regular cadence includes daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for status and risks, sprint demos/reviews, and monthly or milestone stakeholder updates. Escalation paths are defined (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor), and security incidents follow a separate on‑call notification process.

Quality assurance is built into every stage: unit and integration tests for code changes, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed. Metrics and reporting (velocity, burndown, dashboards for errors/latency/usage) inform decisions and validate success metrics defined in the one‑pager. Continuous improvement is enforced via retrospectives that produce prioritized action items tracked back into the backlog so the team can measure impact and iterate on processes.
